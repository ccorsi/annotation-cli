This is a simple project that I created that allows you to define command line arguments using annotations 
and be able to have the them set implicitly without have the application do it itself.  

The other object was to be able to set multiple instances and not be relegated to a single instance.  This 
removes the need to have the application concern itself to setting these values.

The final objective was to be able to set objects besides the primitive types their wrappers, String and 
atomic integer and long instances.  This can be done if the object has a string value constructor.
