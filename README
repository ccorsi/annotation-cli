This is a simple project that allows you to define command line arguments using annotations 
and be able to have the them set implicitly instead of explicitly by the application.  

The other objective was to be able to set multiple instances and not be relegated to a single instance.  This 
removes the need to have the application concern itself to setting these values.

The final objective was to be able to set objects besides the primitive types their wrapper classes, String and 
atomic integer and long instances.  This is done using the class string value constructor.
