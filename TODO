- Split up the OptionsTest into separate test classes that tests the different primitive and wrapper features of this project [done]
- Extract the Simple class from the OptionsTest test into its own source file to allow other tests to use this class [done]

- Improve the README file.
- Add more javadoc that includes a package.html file with information on how to use this library
